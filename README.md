# cirech-clone
An android 2D open source game inspired from the iOS game Cirech by Federico Gentile.
The purpose of this project is to create some reference for those interested in learning some basic 2D Android game concepts.
The code has been written from scratch using Android official APIs only, implements a Model-View-Controller user interface.
I'm looking forward to implement a "low-level" OpenGL graphical engine.
